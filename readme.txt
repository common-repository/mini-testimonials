Testimonial rotation that doesn't create pages for the testimonials. 150 Character max per testimonial.

== Description ==

Do you need to display testimonials or some other short amount of data easily without having an entire page created for such a small thing? Mini Testimonials does not create pages for the testimonials so they are not discoverable by searching. They can only be accessed/viewed with shortcode. This plugin is ideal for anyone who wants to display brief 100 character max testimonials without having an entire page created for such a small set of text.

<br>This plugin does not support WordPress MU.

= Support =
* [Read about installation instructions](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/mini-testimonials/installation)
* [Submit issues to the author](mailto:iwork@ellytronic.com)

=  Features =
* Users can add an unlimited amount of testimonials
* Users can completely style form elements by modifying a few custom classes in their own stylesheets.
* No pages are added to the website meaning these will not show up in search results and the users can only see them when they are called by shortcode

== Installation ==

1. Follow the typical [WordPress plugin installation steps](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Installing_Plugins)
2. If you are unfamiliar with shortcode usage, [learn about shortcodes](http://codex.wordpress.org/Shortcode_API)
3. After installing, on the admin menu, visit the new link under "Pages" titled "Testimonials"
4. Call the form whereever needed by using the shortcode.  This plugin can be called multiple times on the website or a page.

**IMPORTANT!**
* When adding shortcodes to pages or posts be sure to USE THE WORDPRESS HTML EDITOR VIEW, not the Visual editor view.
* Prior to plugin updates its always a good idea to backup event data. Select a plugin from the WordPress Plugins Repository that can backup and restore custom (non-WordPress) tables.
